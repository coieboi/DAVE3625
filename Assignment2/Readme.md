Why i choice "Regression" to predict the stock price of NAS.
From what i could find on the subject, most people prefer to use regression for stock market.
Some says that linear regression is not good for stocks, but it seemed to work well.
Regression algorithm seems like the best fit for me, and it looked like the more feasible one of the two.
There was also a whole lot of source material on regression algorythm's but, most of them didnt work to well, or atleast i could not get them to work.
