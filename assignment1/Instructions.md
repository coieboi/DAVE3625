1. You will be given a data set (from Ruter). Please do the following on this data set:
    1. Identify 5 features from this data set and apply feature engineering on them in Python 
    2. Make atleast 5 data visualization using various python packages.

2. You will be given access to www.bineric.com This is an external data labeling site. You will have to label some data.
(the site is currently down since I am working on the data set. You will have it over the weekend).
